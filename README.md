# Vision

NFT Rarity aims to provide a self hostable or saas solution for NFT projects to provide their rarities.

Additionally, another project will aggregate these instances of NFT Rarity to provide an overview of existing NFT projects.

NFT Rarity will be open source under the GPL v3 license.

# Technologies
- PHP
- Symfony (PHP Framework)
- SQL
- Elasticsearch
- Docker

### PHP & Symfony
PHP & Symfony will be used to provide NFT Rarity UI, API and general Backend.

### SQL
SQL, currently SQLite as default, as saas MYSQL, will be used to store information about NFT projects e.g., NFT #1 with traits x, y.

### Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch will be used to search and aggregate attributes of NFTs, such as name, trait and different trait combination.

### Docker
Self-hosting NFT Rarity should be as easy as possible, therefore docker will be used to provide an easy setup without many requirements.

## Contribution & Donations
I will try my best to make this project come to life and support NFT projects which are either declined by projects like rarity.tools, nftrarity.net or want to host a solution themselves to provide an awesome experience on launch.

Since I'm a fulltime developer and will do this in my freetime and open source it, any contributions are welcome!

Donations (tony-stark.eth) which would let me work more on this are also welcome, but I rather take the contributions and build an open source network of nft developers.
